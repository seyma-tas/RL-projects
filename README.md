Reinforcement learning(RL) is a type of deep learning that has been receiving a lot of attention in the past few years. It is useful for the situations we want to train AI for certain skills we donâ€™t fully understand.
RL has an agent that takes actions in an uncertain environment with the goal of maximizing the cumulative reward. The agent learns from its mistakes and its decision-making algorithm improves.
